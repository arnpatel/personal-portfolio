<h1>Blog Posts</h1>

<p>I blog very less about stuff. My blog entriesâ€”2 in total since I first started this website in January of 2020 typically focus on some engineering stuff for an intended audience of sophomore undergraduate students in my discipline. Topics vary, but most focus is on random topics from electrical and software engineering.</p>
